# Senlima-chielo

"Senlima-chielo" (/senlima t̠ʃielo/) is a plugin for the game [Endless-sky](https://endless-sky.github.io). It replaces the original content with an esperanto translation.

## How to play Senlima-chielo

1. Get the game [Endless-sky](https://endless-sky.github.io),
2. Start the game at least once,
3. Download Senlima-chielo into your plugin directory.

The plugin directory should be located depending on your operating system:

- for Linux either:
    - at `/usr/share/games/endless-sky/plugins/`, or
    - at `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`,
- for Windows either:
    - at `\plugins` in the same directory as the Endless-sky executable, or
    - at `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\`,
- for MacOS either:
    - at `Contents/Resources/plugins/` in the application bundle, or
    - at `~/Library/Application Support/endless-sky/plugins/`.

The directory that should contain the "Senlima-chielo" plugin is the one named `plugins`.

After this, whenever you make a new pilot, you can select the intro "Senlima-chielo" instead of "Endless-sky" and this pilot will use the plugin.
